            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Key Elements of Wedding Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Wedding photography is more than just taking pictures; it's about capturing the emotions, details, and the essence of the day. One of the fundamental elements is the ability to tell a story through images. A skilled wedding photographer will not only capture posed shots but will also document candid moments that reflect the genuine emotions of the couple and their guests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lighting is another crucial aspect of wedding photography. It affects the mood, tone, and overall quality of the photos. Natural light can create beautiful, soft images, especially during the golden hour, which is the period shortly after sunrise or before sunset. Understanding how to work with different lighting conditions is essential for a wedding photographer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Composition and framing are also key components. These techniques involve the arrangement of elements within a photo, guiding the viewer's eye to the focal point. A well-composed photograph can make a significant difference, turning a simple moment into a stunning visual memory.
            </p>
