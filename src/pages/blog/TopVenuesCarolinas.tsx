            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Choosing the Right Venue for Your Photography</h2>
            <p>
              As wedding photographers, we've learned that the best venue for photos isn't always the most expensive or elaborate. Consider these factors when evaluating venues through a photography lens:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Natural Light</h3>
            <p>
              Venues with abundant natural light photograph beautifully. Large windows, open-air spaces, and thoughtful architectural design that maximizes daylight create the most flattering images.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Diverse Photo Locations</h3>
            <p>
              The best venues offer variety—multiple ceremony options, indoor and outdoor spaces, formal and casual settings. This diversity ensures your wedding album tells a complete, varied story.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Backdrop Quality</h3>
            <p>
              Look for venues with beautiful backgrounds—whether mountain views, historic architecture, gardens, or waterfront scenes. These natural backdrops elevate photos without requiring elaborate staging.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Timing Considerations</h3>
            <p>
              Consider how the venue looks at different times of day. Does it have good options for golden hour photos? Are there covered areas for photos if weather doesn't cooperate?
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Regional Photography Advantages</h2>
            <p>
              Each region of the Carolinas offers distinct photographic advantages:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Mountains (Asheville, Boone, Banner Elk):</strong> Dramatic elevation changes, layered mountain ridges, seasonal color changes, rustic and modern venues, cooler temperatures for comfortable outdoor celebrations.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Piedmont (Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro):</strong> Mix of urban and natural settings, historic estates and gardens, consistent weather patterns, excellent indoor-outdoor venue options.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Coastal (Wilmington, Outer Banks, Myrtle Beach area):</strong> Beach sunsets and sunrises, maritime forests, historic lighthouses, water reflections, casual elegance.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Planning Your Venue Visit</h2>
            <p>
              When touring potential wedding venues, bring your photographer if possible, or take detailed photos. Consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Visit at the same time of day as your planned wedding</li>
              <li>Note where the sun will be during ceremony and portraits</li>
              <li>Identify multiple photo locations on the property</li>
              <li>Ask about any photography restrictions or guidelines</li>
              <li>Check backup indoor options for portrait time</li>
              <li>Inquire about vendor access and setup times</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Seasonal Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              Carolina venues shine differently across seasons:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Spring (March-May):</strong> Blooming gardens, mild temperatures, azaleas, dogwoods, and wisteria in peak bloom. Occasional rain requires backup plans.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Lush greenery, warm temperatures (hot in coastal areas), longer daylight hours for extended photo opportunities. Plan for heat and humidity.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Fall (September-November):</strong> Changing leaves (especially mountains), comfortable temperatures, dramatic color palettes, harvest season aesthetics. Peak season for Carolina weddings.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Winter (December-February):</strong> Potential mountain snow, holiday decorations, dramatic lighting, bare trees create interesting lines and textures. Smaller crowds at popular venues.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Maximizing Your Venue's Photography Potential</h2>
            <p>
              Once you've chosen your venue, work with your photographer to maximize its potential:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Schedule site visit with your photographer before the wedding</li>
              <li>Create a shot list that utilizes the venue's best features</li>
              <li>Build in adequate time for photos at multiple locations</li>
              <li>Consider a first look to maximize photo opportunities</li>
              <li>Discuss backup plans for weather-dependent locations</li>
              <li>Coordinate with venue on timing and logistics</li>
            </ul>
