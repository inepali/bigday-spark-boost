            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">The Rise of Drone Wedding Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Just a decade ago, aerial photography required expensive helicopter rentals, making it accessible only to couples with unlimited budgets. Today's advanced drones have democratized aerial photography, allowing professional photographers to capture stunning overhead perspectives at a fraction of the cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern wedding drones are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Compact and portable:</strong> Easily transported to any venue</li>
              <li><strong>Nearly silent:</strong> Modern drones produce minimal noise disruption</li>
              <li><strong>Incredibly stable:</strong> Gimbal technology creates smooth, cinematic footage</li>
              <li><strong>High resolution:</strong> 4K video and high-megapixel photos rival professional cameras</li>
              <li><strong>Safe and regulated:</strong> Licensed operators follow strict FAA guidelines</li>
            </ul>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                Before hiring a photographer for drone coverage, always ask:
              </p>
              <ul className="mb-0">
                <li>"Are you FAA Part 107 certified?"</li>

              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Venue Permissions</h3>

              <li><strong>Blue hour reception:</strong> Twilight venue illumination creates magical atmosphere</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-ceremony venue reveals:</strong> Capture venue setup before guests arrive</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">What Drone Photography Adds to Your Investment</h2>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Cost Considerations</h3>
            <p>
              Drone photography pricing varies based on several factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Included in packages:</strong> Many videographers include basic drone coverage in their wedding packages</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Perspective impossible to achieve any other way</li>
              <li>Showcases venue investment you made</li>
              <li>Dramatic production value elevating your wedding film</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Drone Photography Best Practices for Couples</h2>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Planning for Success</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Verify permissions early:</strong> Check venue drone policies during initial venue tours</li>
              <li><strong>Schedule buffer time:</strong> Allow 15-20 minutes specifically for drone shots</li>
              <li><strong>Consider guest comfort:</strong> Some guests may find drones intrusive—plan accordingly</li>
              <li><strong>Weather backup plan:</strong> Have alternative shot list if weather grounds the drone</li>
              <li><strong>Coordinate with photographer/videographer:</strong> Ensure they work together efficiently</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">During Your Wedding Day</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Trust your pilot:</strong> They're trained professionals focused on safety and results</li>
              <li><strong>Stay in position:</strong> Drone shots require staying relatively still in designated spots</li>
              <li><strong>Ignore the drone:</strong> Look at each other, not up at the drone buzzing overhead</li>
              <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Aerial shots take time to set up and execute properly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Creative Drone Shot Ideas</h2>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Spell It Out</h3>
            <p>
              Arrange your wedding party or guests to spell out words, initials, or create heart shapes visible from above. This requires coordination but creates fun, memorable photos.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Journey Shots</h3>
            <p>
              Capture your journey from venue to venue—following your car along scenic routes between ceremony and reception creates cinematic transitions in your wedding film.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Sunrise/Sunset Time-Lapse</h3>
            <p>
              For multi-day wedding celebrations or venues with overnight accommodations, consider aerial time-lapse sequences showing the venue transforming from day to night.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-foreground">Group Formation Shots</h3>
            <p>
              Organize creative group formations visible from above—bridesmaids' dresses fanned out in a circle, groomsmen forming letters or shapes, or entire guest list arranged in meaningful patterns.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Drone Photography vs. Traditional Aerial Methods</h2>

              </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">The Future of Drone Wedding Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Drone technology continues evolving rapidly, with new innovations enhancing wedding coverage:

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Conclusion: Taking Your Wedding Coverage to New Heights</h2>
            <p>
              Drone wedding photography represents one of the most significant advances in wedding coverage in decades. The breathtaking aerial perspectives, cinematic production value, and unique storytelling opportunities make drone photography an invaluable addition to your wedding documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not essential for every wedding, couples marrying at venues with stunning landscapes, architectural beauty, or expansive grounds benefit tremendously from aerial coverage.
