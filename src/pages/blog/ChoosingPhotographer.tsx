            <p>
              While searching for your perfect photographer, be aware of these warning signs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>No contract or vague contracts:</strong> Professional photographers always use detailed contracts</li>
              <li><strong>Limited portfolio:</strong> You should see multiple complete wedding galleries</li>
              <li><strong>Poor communication:</strong> Responsiveness mattersâ€”slow replies now mean slow delivery later</li>
              <li><strong>No backup plan:</strong> Equipment fails; professionals have backup cameras and contingency plans</li>
              <li><strong>Prices too good to be true:</strong> Extremely low prices often indicate inexperience or hidden costs</li>
              <li><strong>Unwilling to meet in person:</strong> A consultation helps ensure personality compatibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">The Importance of Personality Fit</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
              During your consultation, pay attention to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How well do they listen to your vision?</li>
              <li>Do they offer helpful suggestions without being pushy?</li>
              <li>Are you comfortable being yourself around them?</li>
              <li>Do they seem genuinely excited about your wedding?</li>
              <li>Is their communication style compatible with yours?</li>
            </ul>
